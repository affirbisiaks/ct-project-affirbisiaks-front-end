The vision of our app is to provide periodic positive messages to those who would like.

It provides consistent and customizable encouragement to assist in creating positivity around a particular aspect of oneâ€™s life.

The only reason I seriously do anything is because I care about people and any entity working outside that scope is beyond my concern.

Stretch goals: variable frequencies, affirmation submissions, expanding categories, user stats

Scope: Sends positive affirmations on a consistent basis.

Twilio, Card-Deck, Google oAuth


Functional requirement: 
Users can create, update, and delete profiles.

Non Functional: 

Security Google oAuth - leaves authorization up to google and creates an account with their google account and secures access to their account after creation.
Mock testing will help verify functionality of twilio service without having to send actual texts until production.
